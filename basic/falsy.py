In Python, `if not root` and `if root is None` are used to check if the variable root is referencing the None object, but they have different implications:

if not root: This condition checks if root evaluates to a "falsy" value. In Python, besides None, various other values are considered "falsy," including empty containers (such as empty lists, dictionaries, strings, etc.), numeric zero, and False. If root evaluates to any of these "falsy" values, the condition will be True.Example:

root = None
if not root:
    print("Root is None or falsy value")
if root is None: This condition specifically checks if root is referencing the None object. It will only be True if root is indeed None.Example:


root = None
if root is None:
    print("Root is None")

So, while both conditions can be used to check if root is None, if root is None explicitly checks for None, while if not root checks for any "falsy" value, which may include None as well as other values. The choice between them depends on the specific logic you want to implement.
